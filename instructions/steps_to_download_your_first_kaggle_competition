To download from kaggle the first time
--------------------------------------
These instructions assume you can run a bash shell. I believe the bash commands can be run
in a jupyter notebook using '!' as the prefix (although I am not sure about the apt-get install line)

A specific competition (planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space) is presented here. This competition
was closed, so downloading an open competition for your first download will involve slightly different
steps. If you have already downloaded a competition, then I think there will be fewer steps.

1) Get account at www.kaggle.com
2) "sudo apt-get install python-lxml"
3) "pip install kaggle-cli"          (if this fails due to a permission problem then just append ' --user' and retry)
4) download a json file containing a token specific to your account
   4a) load 'http://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account' in your browser
   4b) click on 'Create New API Token' button
   4c) save as file ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
5) "chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json"   (not critical but will probably prevent irritating security warning messages)
6) accept competition rules
   6a) load 'http://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/rules' in your browser
   6b) click on 'I Understand and Accept' button
   6c) follow the registration steps
7) request access to closed competition
   7a) load 'http://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space' in your browser
   7b) click on 'Late Submission' button that looks like a tab
8) run the kaggle line to download the text
   8a) load 'http://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/data' in your browser
   8b) copy the 'kaggle competitions download -c planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space' text from the API box in the
       Data section that is almost at the bottom of the web page
   8c) paste the 'aggle competitions download -c planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space' text into your bash
       shell and run it
   8d) if you get a '404 Error' then a step above failed and you do not have permission. Just retry and watch for errors
